<p>WE DON'T MAKE CAKES-WE MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE.
<br>
<br>
WE ARE BEST IN PRICES
<br>
<br>
When his dream of slaying on the guitar in a rock band wasn't paying the bills, Chef Duff Goldman turned to his talents as a classically 
trained pastry chef and metal craftsman and founded Charm City Cakes in Baltimore, MD in 2002.
 Duff and his intrepid team of cake decorators churned out cakes the world had never seen before: cakes with sound, cakes
 with smoke, cakes with motorized moving components, life-sized baby elephant cakes- no cake was too crazy to tackle.
<br>
It wasn't long before Charm City Cakes caught the eye of the Food Network where the hit reality cake decorating series Ace of Cakes was born. 
Our Dublin Bakery (founded in 2011) have had the pleasure of making our awesome clients' cake dreams come true for over a decade now!
<br>
Our cakes have taken us everywhere from Dublin to the Inauguration of all major organizations, big wedding events and other grand celebration parties.
<br>
We hope you'll get in touch with us soon. You could be our next and greatest adventure! If you can dream it, we can create it!
